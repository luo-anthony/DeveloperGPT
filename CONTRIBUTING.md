## Making a New Release
This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and tags releases with `X.Y.Z`
Every time a new tag is created and pushed to the remote repo, github actions will
automatically create a new release on github and trigger a release on PyPI.


For this to work you need to setup a secret called `PIPY_API_TOKEN` on the project settings>secrets, 
this token can be generated on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/account/).

To trigger a new release:
1. Bump the version number in `developergpt/VERSION`
2. Run formatting + linting + tests to make sure everything works 
3. Add and commit all changes 
4. Run `git tag v[new-version-number]` (should match the version number in `developergpt/VERSION`)
5. Push changes to Github with tags: `git push origin main --tags`
